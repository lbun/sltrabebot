# Streamlit Dashboard for the trading Bot

The Bot is running every7 minutes and trading if conditions are met.
The bot is saving transactions data in S3 and we would like to have a representation of the daat in an online dashboard that
can be refreshed manually or by push updates. 

Streamlit is one possibility to achieve this.
